# Green-GAN: A Low-Power Adversarial Framework for Proactive Security Audits

## Overview
Green-GAN is an adversarial AI system for generating energy-efficient, realistic adversarial network traffic samples to proactively audit and stress-test Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Designed to be reproducible and accessible, built atop PyTorch with minimal dependencies, and focused on the CICIDS2017 network security benchmark.

## Features
- Full end-to-end pipeline: preprocessing, model training, adversarial generation, and evaluation.
- Low-power/energy-aware GAN design (quantization/pruning/efficient layers).
- Strong baselines: Random Forest, compact neural IDS.
- Visualization and logging included (TensorBoard, example scripts).
- “Small data” mode for fast demo (~15 minutes, CPU/GPU).
